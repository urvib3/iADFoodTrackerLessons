# iADFoodTrackerLessons

Clone Project: 
Click on the green code button > Open with Xcode > Clone.
If you don't already have a project created, change the name to FoodTracker. Otherwise, change it to FoodTracker2 to avoid replacing original project. 
If you've cloned from this project before, you can also go to Source Control > Pull in Xcode, and just pull code from missed lessons instead of cloning the entire thing. 

Terminal: 
If you prefer terminal, cd into whatever folder you want the project to be in, and clone. 
```bash
$cd Desktop
$git clone https://github.com/urvib3/iADFoodTrackerLessons
```

If you have Xcode 11, click on the link below, scroll to the very bottom of the "Work with View Controllers" section, and download file. 
Open the zip file and open up the FoodTracker folder. To open it in Xcode, double click on the FoodTracker.xcodeproj file.
