# iADFoodTrackerLessons

Clone Project: 
Click on the green code button > Open with Xcode > Clone.
If you don't already have a project created, change the name to FoodTracker. Otherwise, change it to FoodTracker2 to avoid replacing original project. 
If you've cloned from this project before, you can also go to Source Control > Pull in Xcode, and just pull code from missed lessons instead of cloning the entire thing. 

Terminal: 
If you prefer terminal, cd into whatever folder you want the project to be in, and clone. 
$cd Desktop
$git clone https://github.com/urvib3/iADFoodTrackerLessons
